Unumanus is a portmanteau of "unum", meaning "one" (or unite) in Latin, and "manus", meaning "script" (I think), pretty much naming it "Uniscript" in a fancy manner.<br>While "uniendis" would work better than "unum", Unumanus sounds better than Uniemanus and it's a bit too late to change that right now.
