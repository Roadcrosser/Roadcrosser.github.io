<p>
The deformed cat knows what it is. An ugly mistake. It knows it should never have existed at all. It knows what it needs to do to remove itself &#x2014; a blemish on life's otherwise wonderful "meaning" &#x2014; from existence. That way the world is a bit lighter, perhaps.
<br>
<br>
So the cat slips down a dark alley and is never seen again, alive. The next day its corpse is found with its ribs exposed to the cold air, bright red and pink innards spilling out of its pathetic little cold body on the ground. Beside these unsightly remains is a single cat's heart. It is as deformed as the cat's existence was.
