<p>
A voice in the ether calls out to you.<br>
Is it a person, or has it been personified?<br>
It could just be one and the same.<br>
<br>
You call out to that voice in the ether.<br>
It responds, a sound calming as a slow river,<br>
while deafening as the fiercest waves.<br>
You try to locate this voice, and you find it.<br>
It comes from within yourself.
