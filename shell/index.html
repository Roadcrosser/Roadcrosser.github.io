    <div id=aaa>
    <p>
        A hermit crab settled into his shell;<br>
        And thought some seaweed would make it look pretty.<br>
        But the shell's demands only grew and grew;<br>
        Just screaming for this and that.<br>
        <br>
        The hermit crab worked hard to adorn this shell;<br>
        Not worrying about the strain on his health.<br>
        "What a beautiful shell!", exclaimed the passing fish,<br>
        unable to see the hermit crab.<br>
        <br>
        Even though they were one and the same;<br>
        a consciousness subservient to his own shell;<br>
        Only living for its sake.
